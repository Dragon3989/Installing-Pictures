Firstly, go to where DevPro is installed, If you do NOT know where this is just right click on however you open devpro and click
"Open file location" 
Now you want to click the address bar and copy it. To do this just click up the top then highlight all of it and click copy
(Or control + C)( Link to Screenshot https://gyazo.com/9d20c6b1f291b6c220a1070fb339f8a6 )
Next, right click on the Zip Folder and when it asks where you would like to extract it just press control V so it pastes the devpro
location. You can also right click on the pic folder and copy and paste it manually in that folder where devpro.exe is. 
If after doing this and it doesn't work make sure you go into your "Pics" Folder and check if there is another folder called "Pics" inside.
Devpro loads images from /pics not /pics/pics.
To fix this simply copy the pic folder inside of that Pics folder and go back to where devpro.exe is and paste the folder there.
